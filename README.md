# More Speed Options
This mod adds two more speed options to the game, complete with buttons and hotkeys.  
> [!WARNING]
Both speeds (especially the fastest) can be a bit buggy so keep an eye on things while your game is sped up.  
Those bugs are very likely caused by the game itself/because of how its coded, so I will not be fixing those.
